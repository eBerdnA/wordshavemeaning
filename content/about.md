The goal of this site is to share content that I find personally interesting. Topics may include IT, philosophy, processes, design, and reading.
Sometimes I have shorter thoughts I’d like to share, so I created a [/notes](/notes) section on this site. Longer articles will be published under [/posts](/posts), while interesting links I come across can be found in the [/links](/links) section.

Practicing the art of writing and sharing knowledge—admittedly for selfish reasons—because I’ve discovered that few things reveal gaps in your understanding as effectively as trying to explain something, even if it’s just in a document no one else ever reads!

Previously, I shared content on [andre.bering.in](andre.bering.in). Some of it may be duplicated here to consolidate the most interesting/relevant material in one place.

## About me

My name is André Bering, and I have been working in the IT industry since 2001. Even earlier I started to tinker with computers, my first computer was actually a Commodore C64.

Over the last 20+ years I have worked in various roles in IT. Starting with system administration, then development, then consulting, I finally ended up in Customer Success. I currently work at JetBrains and help our customers get the most out of TeamCity.

These days, I’m deeply interested in understanding why people do what they do and uncovering their underlying motivations. I believe it’s crucial to start with the “why” rather than jumping straight to the “how.”

At the footer of every page, you’ll find various ways to reach me—feel free to share your questions, feedback, or suggestions about the site’s content. You can even just create a [pull request to contribute](https://github.com/eBerdnA/wordshavemeaning) to this page.

I’d also greatly appreciate it if you let me know when something I’ve written has been helpful to you or others!
