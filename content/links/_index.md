Here are articles and links I found interesting. Entries prefixed with a '#' include personal notes or comments from me, serving as a permanent link to those specific entries.

**Disclaimer**: Sharing a link does not imply endorsement. I share articles I find interesting, thought-provoking, or relevant â€” not necessarily ones I agree with or recommend.

**Please note that Links are not included in the main RSS feed.** If you want to subscribe to my links, you can do so using the following link.
