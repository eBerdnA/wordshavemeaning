I found this one via [Scott Boms blog](https://scottboms.com/documenting/no-longer-tools-but-weapons). The following quote should provide a good teaser on why you should be watching this.

> In pursuit of power and money, technology enabled insidious manipulation at the cellular level of all of our democracies: of us - the voters - microtargeting fear, anger & hate; seeding metanarratives that destroyed trust. It created what the US Surgeon General called an epidemic of loneliness. It turned neighbor against neighbor, rewarding mob rule - rewarding the worst of who we are as people.
