Two paragraphs really stood out for me. First

> One reason is the [capability-reliability gap](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/i/147899150/reliability) — even when a certain capability exists, it may not work reliably enough that you can take the human out of the loop and actually automate the task (imagine a food delivery app that only works 80% of the time). And the methods for improving reliability are often application-dependent and distinct from methods for improving capability. That said, reasoning models also seem to exhibit [reliability improvements](https://youtu.be/iBfQTnA2n2s?si=a-760cPz5ZghJc7w&t=161), which is exciting.

and the second one.

> Finally, while product development lags behind capability, the adoption of AI-based products [further lags](https://x.com/random_walker/status/1850871740550758766) far behind product development, for various behavioral, organizational, and societal reasons. Those interested in AI’s impacts (whether positive or negative) should pay much more attention to these downstream aspects than current or predicted capabilities.
