Originally I wrote at andre.bering.in. Then some time ago I registered a5b5.eu which you're currently looking at.

For quite a while I knew I want to put content here. But I never could decide if I want to redirect my former site here, do redesign and then copy all stuff, or leave the former site as it is and start over fresh here.

After some rumination I came to the conclusion to start fresh. Then I faced the challenge of choosing the right software for running it (as every sane (IT) person does :laugh-cry:). For a while I have been fiddling with different things. Then today (2024-11-18) it clicked while reading [Constraints Are a Good Thing | prepitaph](https://prepitaph.org/articles/constraints/) which I was made aware of via a repost.

Anyhow, now this page is now powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The repo contains both, the scripts and the content.

Check out our [about]({{% ref "/about.md" %}}).
